It is useful to add a colour tint to the Editor whilst it is in Play mode. This makes it easy to tell whether your Scene is running or not.

To set a tint, go to the **Unity** menu and select **Preferences**. Choose the **Colours** menu and find the property called **Play mode tint**.

Click on the existing colour to see a colour wheel where you can choose a colour and opacity level.

Return to the Unity Editor and press the **Play** button to see your new tint in action.
